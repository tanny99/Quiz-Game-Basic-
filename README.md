# Quiz-Game-Basic-
FIRSTLY WE ASK THE NAME OF EVERY PLAYER PLAYING THE GAME,
IN THE FORM OF A CHAR ARRAY(STRING),
THEN WE START THE QUIZ GAME..QUESTION IS ASKED WITH GIVEN 4 OPTIONS.
OUT OF WHICH ONE OPTION IS CORRECT, IF USER CHOOSES THE CORRECT OPTION THEN THERE IS VARIABLE CALLED "count"
WHICH GETS INCREASED BY '1'.. AND IF THE CHOOSEN OPTION IS INCORRECT THEN THERE IS NO CHANGE IN THE VALUE OF COUNT,
AND IF THE ENTERED VALUE IS OUT OF THE OPTIONS THEN PROGRAM PRINTS "INVALID INPUT,
ENTER THE VALUE AGAIN" AND THEN THE VALUE IS AGAIN ASKED(SCANNED),
AND HENCE THE SAME PROCESS IS REPEATED FOR THE NEXT 10 QUESTIONS.
NOW WE OPEN A FILE WITH NAME "quiz_game_results.txt" IN THE APPEND MODE,
AND USE "fprintf" TO PRINT THE NAME AND THE SCORE OF THE PLAYER ON THE TEXT FILE OPENED.
IN THIS WAY EACH TIME WHEN THE CODE IS RUN, 
THEN NAME OF THE PLAYER AND THE SCORE IS UPDATED TO THE FILE.
NOW WE OPEN THE TEXT FILE "quiz_game_results.txt" IN READ MODE,
WE USE A WHILE LOOP UNTILL THE FILE POINTER REACHES THE END OF FILE,
AND SCANS ALL THE SCORES FROM THE FILE.
EACH TIME WHEN THE LOOP IS RUN, WE GET A SCORE AND THAT SCORE GET PUSHED IN A STACK..
A STACK WHICH TAKES THE DATA WITH VALUE GREATER THEN THE VALUE OF ITS TOP ELEMENT, 
AND THE TOP ELEMENT IS THE SCORE OF THE FIRST PERSON WHO HAS PLAYED,
THIS IS HOW WE UPDATE THE HIGHEST SCORE. AND WE USE "STACK2", ANOTHER STACK,
WHICH STORES SCORES OF EVERY PLAYER PLAYED, AND THEN A GLOBAL FUNCTION IS CALLED WITHIN THE STACK, 
WHICH SORTS THE SCORE IN DESCENDING ORDER,BASICALLY WE USE A INSERTION SORT FUNCTION.
AND WE OPEN A NEW FILE IN A APPEND MODE NAMED-"quiz_game_ranking.txt" IN THIS FILE WE PRINT ALL THE NAMES WE GET AFTER ARRANGING IN DESCENDING ORDER,
THESE ARE THE RANKING OF THE PLAYERS.
